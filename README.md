# ESP32SPingMasterForMyHome
Here used esp32 as a microcontroller, 128x64 lcd as a output display and ws2812b pixel led as an status indicator. <br>It ping google in every 8 sec and shows result like average time (latency), <br>if ping is successful then it also shows "Online" in display, otherwise it shows "No internet". <br>This is very useful device for home WiFi network, because sometimes we don't know our internet connection<br> provided by an ISP is working properly or not. 
One other big advantages is it shows Real Time from NTP server in big font. <br>
It shows connected WiFi device and its signal strength.
